# rubberduk
A EULA, TOS, and Privacy Policy scanner that identifies concerning clauses specifically relating to user privacy, data, and security.
<h2> Mission Statement </h2>
rubberduk is an attempt at making a system to allow for users of online platforms to be more informed of the conditions and terms within TOS's, EULA's, and Privacy Policies when using said platforms. The goal is to give users more power over their data and consent through knowledge and understanding of agreements and policies.
<h2> Approach </h2>
We aim to accomplish this goal through a few fundamental techniques, which when broken down, are quite simple. 
</br></br>Note: Due to extremely limited resources, the approach is tailored to cost effective, and ready to use methods and systems. As we do not have the resources (time, cost, computational power) to train models on relevant data sets. In an ideal situation we would build multiple custom models trained on legal, agreement, and data privacy text.

<ol> <li>Zero Shot Classification <ul> <li>This utilizes natural language processing models trained on significantly large corpuses of data, where they will then attempt to match a given set of text to a set of labels. It will then produce scores for how close it believes a specific section of text matches a set label</li></ul></li> <li>Multi Model Fusion <ul><li> Utilizing multiple models allows for more accurate results. As different models have been trained with different data and have different biases. This will <i>hopefully</i> void the issue of biased results, as it should average out between multiple models </li></ul></li> <li>Text Batching <ul><li>To simplify the context system we have added a batching system. Which will take a documents text, cut it into chunks dependent on the specified sentence size, and pass it to the model for labelling. This is a resource efficent approach that can give the model both pre an post cursor context to <i>hopefully</i> provide more accurate estimations on label scores</li></ul></li> <li>Sliding Window</li> <li> Score Averaging </li></ol>
