 We order (or “rank”) the content you can see in your Feed, and you can learn more about the different types of signals we use to rank it
 We also suggest content that’s relevant to you
Many things influence the content you see in your Feed
For example:If your friends, connections or people you may know interact with a Facebook Page, post or certain topic, we can suggest similar content to you
 So if your friend Ahmad comments on a post about national parks, we can suggest the national parks post to you
If you and others interact with the same group, Facebook Page or post, we can suggest another group, Page or post that they interact with for you
 So if you and Sharmila are in the same cat lovers group and Sharmila likes a Page that sells scarves, we might suggest the scarves Page to you
If you’ve recently engaged with a certain topic on Facebook, we might then suggest other posts that are related to that topic
 So if you recently liked or commented on a post from a basketball Page, we could suggest other posts about basketball
You might see posts based on where you are and what people near you are interacting with on Facebook
 So if you’re near a sports stadium, we can suggest games or events occurring at the stadium

Take control How to manage your Facebook Feed Facebook Help Center How to manage your Instagram feed Instagram Help CenterManage Facebook Feed33Your activity on our ProductsFor example, William checks into a local bakery on Facebook, so later we might show him ads on Instagram for other local bakeries
Your activity on third-party websites and apps, depending on your settingsFor example, Jane buys a pair of shoes from an online shoe store or in an online chat with a shoe seller
 The seller shares Jane’s activity with us using our Business Tools, subject to our Business Tools Terms
Later, Jane sees an ad on Instagram for a discount on her next shoe purchase from the online store
If she doesn't want to see ads from this shoe store again, she can hide them in her Advertisers setting
 Or if she doesn’t want us to show her any ads based on her activity on other websites and apps, she can make sure that this setting is turned off in her ad preferences
Topics we think you might be interested inFor example, Jon likes several Facebook Pages about famous musicians, so we think he has an interest in "music
"Based on this interest, we might show him an ad for a local record shop or an online music publication
Jon can manage his interests in his ad topics
Your connectionsFor example, Fiona’s friend likes an Instagram account for a local art fair
 Based on her friend’s activity, we might show Fiona an ad for the art fair
34Other device signals we receiveWe receive different types of device signals from different operating systems
 They include things like nearby Bluetooth or Wi-Fi connections
35IP addressStands for "internet protocol address

36Personalizing ads for you and othersFor example, Marcus is going on a trip and wants to use Find Wi-Fi to find free, public Wi-Fi at the airport
 He has turned on Location Services on his device and allowed location access on the Facebook app, so we can use his GPS information to help him find the most relevant public Wi-Fi networks
 We’ll also use this information to show him ads for local businesses near the airport
Later, Marcus turns off Location Services before he lands, so we don’t collect his GPS information anymore
 Later on his trip, he opens the Facebook app, and we can use the IP address we receive to estimate Marcus’ general location and show him ads for businesses nearby
37Helping to keep your account secureFor example, we use information about the locations you normally log in from, combined with other information, to detect suspicious activity
 So if we detect an attempt to log into your account from a new location, we can check that it’s really you
