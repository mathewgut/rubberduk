3. USER GENERATED CONTENT: SUBMISSIONS INCLUDING COMMENTS, READER REVIEWS AND MORE

3.1 If you upload, post or submit any content on the Service, you represent to us that you have all the necessary legal rights to upload, post or submit such content and it will not violate any law or the rights of any person. You shall not upload to, or distribute or otherwise publish on to the Services any libelous, defamatory, obscene, pornographic, abusive, or otherwise illegal material. You shall not impersonate anyone else or otherwise misrepresent your identity, affiliation or status. You agree not to provide material and misleading information knowingly and with intent to defraud. You shall not upload to, or distribute or otherwise publish on to the Services any malware, viruses, spyware, or other malicious software or files to the Services. You shall not use automated means to upload to, or distribute or otherwise publish onto, the Services any content.

Be courteous. You agree that you will not threaten or verbally abuse other members, use defamatory language, or deliberately disrupt discussions with repetitive messages, meaningless messages or "spam."

Use respectful language. Like any community, the online conversation flourishes only when our members feel welcome and safe. You agree not to use language that abuses or discriminates on the basis of race, religion, nationality, gender, sexual preference, age, region, disability, etc. Hate speech of any kind is grounds for immediate and permanent suspension of access to all or part of the Services.

Debate, but don't attack. In a community full of opinions and preferences, people always disagree. NYT encourages active discussions and welcomes heated debate on the Services, but personal attacks are a direct violation of these Terms of Service and are grounds for immediate and permanent suspension of access to all or part of the Service.

3.2 The Services shall be used only in a noncommercial manner. You shall not, without the express approval of NYT, distribute or otherwise publish any material containing any solicitation of funds, advertising or solicitation for goods or services.

3.3 You acknowledge that any submissions you make to the Services (i.e., user-generated content including but not limited to: comments, forum messages, reviews, text, video, audio and photographs, as well as computer code and applications) (each, a "Submission") may be edited, removed, modified, published, transmitted, and displayed by NYT and you waive any rights you may have in having the material altered or changed in a manner not agreeable to you. Submissions made to the Services may also be included in our RSS feeds and APIs and made available for republishing through other formats.

3.4 You grant NYT a perpetual, nonexclusive, world-wide, royalty-free, sub-licensable license to the Submissions, which includes without limitation the right for NYT, or any third party it designates, to use, copy, transmit, excerpt, publish, distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, communicate to the public, create derivative works of, host, index, cache, tag, encode, modify and adapt (including without limitation the right to adapt to streaming, downloading, broadcast, mobile, digital, thumbnail, scanning or other technologies) in any form or media now known or hereinafter developed, any Submission posted by you on or to the Services or any other website owned by NYT, including any Submission posted on or to the Services through a third party. Among other things, NYT licenses comments to third parties for academic, governmental, financial and corporate use. In these cases, steps are taken to remove personal information from such comments.

3.5 You are solely responsible for the content of your Submissions. However, while NYT does not and cannot review every Submission and is not responsible for the content of these messages, NYT reserves the right to delete, move, or edit Submissions that it, in its sole discretion, deems abusive, defamatory, obscene, in violation of copyright or trademark laws, in violation of these Terms of Service, or otherwise unacceptable.

3.6 By making a Submission, you are consenting to its display and publication on the Site and in the Services and for related online and offline promotional uses.

5.2 NYT does not represent or endorse the accuracy or reliability of any advice, opinion, statement, or other information displayed, uploaded, or distributed through the Services by any user, information provider or any other person or entity. NYT will not be liable to you or any other person as a result of a user’s interactions with other users. You acknowledge that any reliance upon any such opinion, advice, statement, memorandum, or information shall be at your sole risk. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAWS, THE SERVICES AND ALL SOFTWARE ARE DISTRIBUTED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

THESE LIMITATIONS APPLY WHETHER THE ALLEGED LIABILITY IS BASED ON NEGLIGENCE, TORT, CONTRACT, OR OTHER THEORY OF LIABILITY, EVEN IF ANY OF THE NYT PARTIES HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF OR COULD HAVE FORESEEN ANY OF THE EXCLUDED DAMAGES, AND IRRESPECTIVE OF ANY FAILURE OF AN ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF A LIMITED REMEDY. IF ANY APPLICABLE AUTHORITY HOLDS ANY PORTION OF THIS SECTION TO BE UNENFORCEABLE, THEN THE NYT PARTIES' LIABILITY WILL BE LIMITED TO THE FULLEST POSSIBLE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.

6. REGISTRATION AND SECURITY

6.1 As part of the registration or account creation process, you will create login credentials by selecting a password and providing an e-mail address or by linking another account, such as your Apple, Facebook or Google accounts. You also can be requested to provide certain registration information, which must be accurate and updated.

Each registration is for a single user only. You are not allowed to share your registration login credentials or give your login credentials to anyone else. We may cancel or suspend your access to the Services if you share your login credentials. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password, which you will not have to reveal to any representative or agent of NYT. You may not (i) select or use the login credentials of another person with the intent to impersonate that person; (ii) use login credentials in which another person has rights without such person's authorization; or (iii) use login credentials that we, in our sole discretion, deem offensive. Failure to comply with the foregoing shall constitute a breach of these Terms of Service, which may result in immediate suspense or termination of your account.

You consent to receive notifications from us electronically to the e-mail address you provide to us. You agree that all notices, disclosures, and other communications that we provide to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that such communications be in writing. You agree that you have the ability to store such electronic communications such that they remain accessible to you in an unchanged form.

6.2 Please notify help@nytimes.com of any known or suspected unauthorized use(s) of your account, or any known or suspected breach of security, including loss, theft, or unauthorized disclosure of your password or credit card information.

6.3 You must be 13 years or older to use any part of the Services in the USA and the UK, and 16 years or older anywhere else. If you are less than 18 years of age and would like to use, subscribe or register to any part of the Services, please ask your parent or legal guardian to review and agree to these Terms of Service before you use any part of the Services or ask them to complete the purchase and/or registration on your behalf.

6.4 You are responsible for all usage or activity on your account with NYT, including use of the account by any third party authorized by you to use your login credentials. Any fraudulent, abusive, or otherwise illegal activity may be grounds for termination of your account, at our sole discretion, and we may refer you to appropriate law-enforcement agencies.

6.5 If your access to any Service has been provided by or through a third party (for example, your employer or an educational institution at which you are a student) (each, a “Client”), the Client may have provided us with information about you to enable us to provide you with access to the Services and distinguish you from other subscribers (such as your IP address, email address or name). 

7. FEES AND PAYMENTS

7.1. We reserve the right at any time to charge fees for access to portions of the Services or the Services as a whole. In no event, however, will you be charged for access to the Services unless we obtain your prior agreement to pay such charges. Thus, if at any time we require a fee for portions of the Services that are now free, we will give you advance notice of such fees. You may cancel your account at any time (see Section 10.1 regarding termination of service). All new fees, if any, will be posted prominently on the Site and in other appropriate locations on the Service. You shall pay all fees and charges incurred through your account at the rates in effect for the billing period in which such fees and charges are incurred, including, but not limited to charges for any digital products or services offered for sale through the Services by us or by any other vendor or service provider. All fees and charges shall be billed to and paid for by you. You shall pay all applicable taxes relating to use of the Services through your account.

8. THIRD-PARTY CONTENT AND LINKS TO THIRD-PARTY WEBSITES.

8.1 The Services contain links to third-party websites, resources, and advertisers (collectively, “Linked Content”). NYT does not control, endorse, sponsor, recommend or otherwise accept responsibility for any of this Linked Content. Because we are not responsible for the availability of these outside resources, or their contents or privacy practices, you should direct any concerns regarding any Linked Content to such site.

9. SOFTWARE LICENSES

9.1 You shall have no rights to the proprietary software and related documentation, or any enhancements or modifications thereto, provided to you in order to access the Services ("Software"). You may not sublicense, assign or transfer any licenses granted by NYT, and any attempt at such sublicense, assignment or transfer shall be null and void. You may make one copy of such Software for archival purposes only. You may not otherwise copy, distribute, modify, reverse engineer, or create derivative works from Software.

10. TERMINATION; SURVIVAL

10.1 You may terminate your account at any time by calling Customer Care at 866-273-3612 (please see our international contact information if you are outside the U.S.) or chatting with Customer Care here.

10.3 The provisions of these Terms of Service shall survive the termination of your account or access to all or part of the Services. 

11. GOVERNING LAW; JURISDICTION

11.1 These Terms of Service have been made and shall be construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the United States of America and the State of New York as an agreement wholly performed therein without regard to their conflict of law provisions and the United Nations Conventions on Contracts (if applicable).

11.2 Any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the Services or these Terms of Services must be filed within one year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred. Any claim by you that may arise in connection with these Terms of Service will be compensable by monetary damages and you will in no event be entitled to injunctive or other equitable relief. 

12. WAIVER OF CLASS ACTIONS; ARBITRATION

12.1 Binding Arbitration. You and NYT acknowledge that any statutory or common law claims related to intellectual property may require forms of equitable relief that are best administered by courts; accordingly, you and NYT agree that, except for i) statutory or common law claims related to intellectual property, and ii) any claims that may be brought in small claims court where the amount in controversy is properly within the jurisdiction of such court (collectively, “Excluded Claims”), any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to the Terms of Service, the Terms of Sale, your relationship to NYT as a subscriber, or your use of any of NYT’s Services, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory (the “Covered Claims”), will be resolved by binding, individual arbitration.  YOUR AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATION MEANS THAT FOR ALL COVERED CLAIMS, YOU ARE GIVING UP YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT AND THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY.  INSTEAD, YOU WILL HAVE A HEARING BEFORE A NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR.

12.2 WAIVER OF CLASS ACTIONS. YOU AND NYT AGREE THAT EACH PARTY MAY BRING DISPUTES RELATING TO BOTH COVERED CLAIMS AND EXCLUDED CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER PARTY ONLY IN AN INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, A FEDERAL OR STATE CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT OR A CLASS ARBITRATION.
12.3. Conduct of Arbitration; Governing Rules.  Arbitrations for any disputes between us relating to the Covered Claims will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) in accordance with its Consumer Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Rules for Multiple Case Filings (collectively, the “AAA Rules”). For more information about arbitration, the AAA and the arbitration process, please consult the American Arbitration Association web site at adr.org.  All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except that issues relating to the scope, application, and enforceability of the arbitration provision–including whether any claims are Covered Claims or Excluded Claims within the meaning of this provision–are for the court to decide.  As stated in Section 11, New York law applies to any arbitration under this section, but the parties acknowledge that the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision.  This arbitration agreement does not preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies, and, if the law allows, they can seek relief against us for you.

Prior to initiating arbitration for a Covered Claim, both parties agree that they will provide individualized written notice of the potential claim to the opposing party setting forth (i) the factual and legal basis for the claim; (ii) contact information for the potential claimant and their counsel, if any; and (iii) the remedies sought, including the amount of claimed monetary damages (the “Notice”).  Following receipt of the Notice by the opposing party, the parties agree to make a good faith effort for at least 30 days to resolve the claim before resorting to more formal means of resolution, including, without limitation, arbitration or any court action. To provide notice of a claim to NYT, write to legal@nytimes.com or The New York Times Company, Attn: Legal Department, 620 Eighth Avenue, New York, NY 10018.

Unless you and NYT agree otherwise in writing, any hearings for the arbitration will take place in a location to be determined in accordance with the AAA Rules.  Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA Rules, except that if the arbitrator finds at any time that a claim was filed frivolously, for purposes of harassment, or otherwise in bad faith, then the filing party will reimburse the other party for all costs and fees, including attorneys’ fees, associated with that claim.

Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any federal or state court of competent jurisdiction located in the County of New York in the State of New York. The arbitrator may award money or equitable relief in favor of only the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim. To reduce the time and expense of the arbitration, the arbitrator will not provide a statement of reasons for his or her award unless requested to do so by both parties. 

12.4 For all litigation regarding Excluded Claims and any other controversy or claim for which arbitration is denied, the sole jurisdiction and venue for such litigation will be an appropriate federal or state court located in the County of New York in the State of New York.

12.5 All provisions of this Dispute Resolution – Arbitration and Waiver of Class Actions Section shall survive termination of these Terms of Service and the Terms of Sale, your relationship with us, and/or your account or profile.

13.6 If a provision of these Terms of Service is held invalid or unenforceable for any reason, that provision will be deemed severable and shall be construed in a manner consistent with applicable law to reflect, as nearly as possible, the intention of the parties.
