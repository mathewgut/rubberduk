["In general, data relating to other users, including names and email addresses, or personal details, should not be publicly posted on the Internet. I have a question about the privacy of other users: Why would they be afraid that others may be able to find personal information of them? Is this a legitimate concern? Are you sure the person you are claiming to represent is a person? If so, it's not really a privacy issue, as long as they are not posting their personal information, since that's their personal data about others.", 'I think the excerpts in that section should be removed, but it might be that some information is infringing on copyrights and the copyright owner has the right to refuse to share the information, but the license that you were granted does not protect it from being misused. In addition to your question about data, how should the excerpts be changed? Is there a way to request permissions from whoever the data owner is, and would you agree to not be notified if you were not aware that they were leaking to others?', 'This may be a privacy issue, or possibly, a privacy issue in general. What does the section on potential data use concern entail? How might the city of Mississauga use this information? Where can the information be used? What does the purpose of such data use? How is it handled? Is this a privacy concern for anyone? Why would it be? You might not find the full paragraph to be helpful for your question. However, there are no additional sections for the purpose of that conversation.']
