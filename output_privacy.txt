Your information Our Privacy Policy explains how we treat your personal data and protect your privacy when you use the Service.', "This isn't really a privacy concern. The only privacy concern is that the content is not made public. There's a large portion of the content not made public because YouTube is only showing a portion of it. Currently YouTube hasn't re-done this. The YouTube content that is made public is essentially the same as the content that's made public. We're not making YouTube about sharing the content with people we do know personally or that we could potentially sell to other companies.", 'To be clear, the actual terms and conditions of the service do not specifically govern any aspects of how a user may use the service, nor do they make an informed choice regarding its use. YouTube and others have not stated that they will never sell your personal information to third parties. YouTube and other third parties may however, refuse to sell your personal information to anyone else. The only thing that YouTube will do is prohibit a user from selling the information to third parties, and it is illegal for third parties to make copies of the information on YouTube.', 'In addition to what was already explained, YouTube has several agreements that cover how the service is used. These include how you may cease use of the service and what to do if you lose service. Also, YouTube does not allow access to data that was uploaded to or used by the YouTube account. If you are unable tonettoyage the service, you can take the steps of closing the YouTube account and downloading a copy of your data.

That's not a privacy concern, and a liability limitation isn't a limitation on a liability. It's a limitation on liability in that sense. In addition to the limitation on liability, the clause also says that YouTube is prohibited from charging its users for access to the service. So the liability in this clause is not limited to the amount YouTube has paid to you from the service, but to the actual value that YouTube has paid to you for access to the service.", 'YouTube has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for, such websites and online services.
