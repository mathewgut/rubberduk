By using the Game and/or Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms and the Privacy Policy (available at https://www.recroom.com/privacy-policy) (the "Privacy Policy") that is incorporated by reference into these Terms. If you don't agree to be bound by these Terms, do not use the Game or Services. If you are accessing or using the Game or Services on behalf of a company (such as your employer) or other legal entity, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind that company or other legal entity to these Terms. In that case, "you" and "your" will refer to that company or other legal entity. Otherwise, "you" and "your" will refer to you, individually.

Grant of License

Subject to these Terms, Rec Room Inc grants you a nonexclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, limited right and license to use one copy of the Game for your personal non-commercial use for gameplay. The term of your license begins on the date that you install or otherwise use the Game and ends on the earlier date of either your disposal of the Game or Rec Room Inc's termination of this Agreement. Your license terminates immediately if you attempt to circumvent any technical protection measures used in connection with the Game or if you violate these Terms. The Game is being licensed to you and you hereby acknowledge that no title or ownership in the Game is being transferred or assigned and these Terms should not be construed as a sale of any rights in the Game. All rights not specifically granted under these Terms are reserved by Rec Room Inc.

Rec Room Inc may modify the Terms at any time, in our sole discretion. If we do so, we will let you know either by posting the modified Terms wherever the Game may be downloaded or through other communications. Please make sure you review the modified Terms because if you continue to use the Game and/or Services after we have posted modified Terms, you are indicating to us that you agree to be bound by the modified Terms. If you don't agree to be bound by the modified Terms, then you may not use the Game or Services anymore. Because the Game and Services are evolving over time, we may change or discontinue all or any part of the Game and/or Services, at any time and without notice, at our sole discretion.

Rec Tokens, Rec Token Transactions, the Creator Payment Program, and the Video Partner Program

Eligible users of Rec Room may acquire, under a limited and revocable license, our virtual in-game currency ("Rec Tokens"), solely for use in connection with activities within Rec Room. In addition, eligible creators of User Content may, through the Creator Payment Program, apply to cash out earned Rec Tokens for U.S. dollars.

REC TOKENS

Subject to eligibility and Rec Token license terms, you may acquire Rec Tokens: (i) by purchasing Rec Tokens directly from us; (ii) by subscribing to Rec Room Plus; (iii) through contests, promotions, or other means of distribution determined by us from time-to-time in our sole discretion; or (iv) through creating User Content which you then make available within Rec Room to other users in exchange for Rec Tokens those users have purchased or earned. Your license to use Rec Tokens will terminate upon termination of these Terms or your license to access Rec Room, or as otherwise provided in the Terms. Users shall be subject to daily purchase limits, as may be implemented or changed by Rec Room Inc. in its sole discretion, and in any event are prohibited from purchasing more than $10,000 in Rec Tokens in any one calendar day. All payments for Rec Tokens are final and not refundable or exchangeable, except as required by applicable law.

Other than in circumstances meeting all requirements of the Creator Payment Program, Rec Tokens do not have an equivalent value in, nor act as a substitute for, any other currency, whether real or virtual. Nor do Rec Tokens earn interest. Transactions involving the exchange of Rec Tokens for virtual items or virtual services, including User Content, in Rec Room are not legally enforceable, may not form the basis of any private right of action against Rec Room Inc. or any user or any other third party, and are governed solely by Rec Room Inc. in its discretion. You acknowledge and agree that Rec Room Inc. may engage in actions that may impact the perceived value or acquired price of Rec Tokens at any time, and for any reason, except as prohibited by applicable law.

Our license to permit you to acquire Rec Tokens, if granted, is non-exclusive, revocable, personal, limited, non-transferable (except as specifically set out in these Terms), and permits you to use Rec Tokens solely for your individual, personal, entertainment use exclusively within Rec Room. You may not transfer, assign, sell, gift, exchange, trade, convert, lease, sublicense, rent, or distribute Rec Tokens except in accordance with these Terms and, as applicable, the Creator Payment Program, or as otherwise expressly permitted by us. Any disposition or attempted disposition of Rec Tokens in violation of these Terms will be void and may result in revocation of your license to use Rec Tokens and/or termination of your access to Rec Room. We do not recognize, condone or support any third-party services that may be used to sell, exchange, transfer, or otherwise dispose of Rec Tokens, other than the third party we have authorized to facilitate exchange payments through the Creator Payment Program. Rec Room Inc., in its sole discretion, may impose additional or other limits on Rec Tokens and the Creator Payment Program, including, but not limited to, the amount that may be acquired, earned, transferred, redeemed or otherwise disposed of at any given time.

REC TOKEN TRANSACTIONS

When licensed to utilize Rec Tokens, you will be able to use them as payment within Rec Room to access (i) certain Content provided by us, as well as (ii) User Content created and offered by other users in user-to-user transactions. All transactions in Rec Tokens will be governed by these Terms. User-to-user Rec Token transactions may also be governed by terms negotiated between you and another user, provided such additional terms do not violate these Terms, the Code of Conduct, the Creator Payment Program Rules, and Rec Room policy, or additional policies we may impose in our sole discretion at any time. Rec Token transactions may be accounted for or facilitated by us or our designated third party service providers. Once completed, Rec Token transactions are final and non-refundable, except as may be required by applicable law, or otherwise determined by us in our sole discretion. Rec Room Inc. reserves the right to reject any Rec Token transaction for User Content, on behalf of itself or any user, and reserves the right to suspend or terminate any user account in the event of unauthorized or fraudulent charges or activity, whether suspected or actual.

As the recipient of Rec Tokens which you earn through user-to-user Rec Token transactions for access to your original User Content, you may, if and while eligible for the Creator Payment Program and subject to the Creator Payment Program Rules, be able to cash out certain amounts of such earned Rec Tokens for U.S. Dollars.

Content creators offering and distributing User Content are solely responsible for all matters arising from their User Content and related user-to-user Rec Token transactions, including promptly resolving in good faith any complaints or other matters arising from such User Content and such transactions. While Rec Room may charge service, transaction or other fees for our role in facilitating such user-to-user transactions within Rec Room, such transactions are strictly between the participating users.

Although we are not responsible for resolving disputes among users about user-to-user Rec Token transactions, we reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to intervene to attempt to mitigate or resolve such disputes. To the extent we choose to become involved in a dispute, you understand and agree that our decision, which may include reallocating, refunding, or crediting Rec Tokens from one user to another in our sole discretion, is final. In the event you are involved in any such dispute, you agree to work with us in a good faith and prompt manner to resolve the dispute.

CREATOR PAYMENT PROGRAM

Rec Room Inc., in its sole discretion, may allow eligible creators of User Content to participate in the Creator Payment Program. Creators of User Content participating in this program may, subject to compliance with all program terms and the requirements of our third-party payment vendor, exchange Rec Tokens they have earned for U.S. Dollars, based upon an exchange ratio and other requirements, procedures, and limitations established by us in our sole discretion from time to time, including those set forth in the Creator Payment Program Rules, which are incorporated by reference into these Terms. Rec Tokens are "earned" when creators of original User Content receive them from another Rec Room user in exchange for access to such User Content. Rec Tokens acquired in other ways (e.g., as part of a Rec Room Plus subscription, in connection with a contest, or purchased directly from Rec Room) are not considered "earned."

Rec Room Inc., in its sole discretion, has the absolute right to manage, modify, suspend, revoke, and terminate the Creator Payment Program without notice, refund, compensation, or liability to any user, except as otherwise prohibited by applicable law. Any actions or omissions in violation of law, these Terms, the Code of Conduct, the Creator Payment Program Rules, or any Rec Room policy, may result in the suspension or termination of a given user's access to the Creator Payment Program and void any pending transactions thereunder.

VIDEO PARTNER PROGRAM

Rec Room Inc., in its sole discretion, may allow eligible users of Rec Room to participate in the Video Partner Program. Such eligible users participating in this program may be able to earn certain revenue from the in-app purchases of other users of Rec Room who have chosen to support you, subject to compliance with these Terms, requirements of our third-party payment vendor, and other requirements, procedures, and limitations established by us in our sole discretion from time to time, including those set forth in the Video Partner Program rules, which are incorporated by reference into these Terms.

Rec Room Inc., in its sole discretion, has the absolute right to manage, modify, suspend, revoke, and terminate the Video Partner Program, without notice, refund, compensation, or liability to any user, except as otherwise prohibited by applicable law. Any actions or omissions in violation of law, these Terms, the Code of Conduct, the Video Partner Program rules, or any Rec Room policy, may result in the suspension or termination of a given user's access to the Video Partner Program and void any revenue earned thereunder.

Dispute Resolution

Governing Law

These Terms and any action related thereto will be governed by the laws of the State of Washington without regard to its conflict-of-laws provisions.

Agreement to Arbitrate

You and Rec Room Inc agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof or the use of the Services or Content (collectively, "Disputes") will be settled by binding arbitration, except that each party retains the right: (i) to bring an individual action in small claims court and (ii) to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party's copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights (the action described in the foregoing clause (ii), an "IP Protection Action"). Without limiting the preceding sentence, you will also have the right to litigate any other Dispute if you provide Rec Room Inc with written notice of your desire to do so by email or regular mail within thirty (30) days following the date you first agree to these Terms (such notice, an "Arbitration Opt-out Notice"). If you don't provide Rec Room Inc with an Arbitration Opt-out Notice within the thirty (30) day period, you will be deemed to have knowingly and intentionally waived your right to litigate any Dispute except as expressly set forth in clauses (i) and (ii) above. The exclusive jurisdiction and venue of any IP Protection Action or, if you timely provide Rec Room Inc with an Arbitration Opt-out Notice, will be the state and federal courts located in the Western District of Washington and each of the parties hereto waives any objection to jurisdiction and venue in such courts. Unless you timely provide Rec Room Inc with an Arbitration Opt-out Notice, you acknowledge and agree that you and Rec Room Inc are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action or representative proceeding. Further, unless both you and Rec Room Inc otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding. If this specific paragraph is held unenforceable, then the entirety of this "Dispute Resolution" section will be deemed void. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, this "Dispute Resolution" section will survive any termination of these Terms.

Arbitration Rules

The arbitration will be administered by JAMS alternative dispute resolution ("JAMS") in accordance with the applicable JAMS clauses, rules, and procedures (the "JAMS Rules") then in effect, except as modified by this "Dispute Resolution" section. (The JAMS Rules are available at http://www.jamsadr.com/adr-rules-procedures/ or by calling JAMS at 1-800-352-5267.) The Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Section.

Arbitration Process

A party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the JAMS Rules. The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law and will be selected by the parties from JAMS's roster of arbitrators. If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within seven (7) days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration, then JAMS will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the JAMS Rules.

Arbitration Location and Procedure

Unless you and Rec Room Inc otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted at JAMS's Seattle, Washington offices located at 600 University Street, Suite 1910 Seattle, WA 98101. If your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of the documents that you and Rec Room Inc submit to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary. If your claim exceeds $10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by the JAMS Rules. Subject to the JAMS Rules, the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.

Arbitrator's Decision

The arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the JAMS Rules. The arbitrator's decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator's award of damages must be consistent with the terms of the "Limitation of Liability" section above as to the types and amounts of damages for which a party may be held liable.

Fees

Your responsibility to pay any JAMS filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the JAMS Rules.

Changes

Notwithstanding the provisions of the "Changes to Terms and Services" section above, if Rec Room Inc changes this "Dispute Resolution" section after the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the date such change became effective, as indicated in the "Last Updated" date above or in the date of Rec Room Inc's email to you notifying you of such change. By rejecting any change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any Dispute between you and Rec Room Inc in accordance with the provisions of this "Dispute Resolution" section as of the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms).

General Terms

These Terms constitute the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between Rec Room Inc and you regarding the Services and Content, and these Terms supersede and replace any and all prior oral or written understandings or agreements between Rec Room Inc and you regarding the Services and Content. If any provision of these Terms is held invalid or unenforceable (either by an arbitrator appointed pursuant to the terms of the "Arbitration" section above or by court of competent jurisdiction, but only if you timely opt out of arbitration by sending us an Arbitration Opt-out Notice in accordance with the terms set forth above), that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the other provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect. You may not assign or transfer these Terms, by operation of law or otherwise, without Rec Room Inc's prior written consent. Any attempt by you to assign or transfer these Terms, without such consent, will be null. Rec Room Inc may freely assign or transfer these Terms without restriction. Subject to the foregoing, these Terms will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted assigns. Any notices or other communications provided by Rec Room Inc under these Terms, including those regarding modifications to these Terms, will be given: (i) via email; or (ii) by posting to the Services. For notices made by e-mail, the date of receipt will be deemed the date on which such notice is transmitted. Rec Room Inc's failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of such right or provision. The waiver of any such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of Rec Room Inc. Except as expressly set forth in these Terms, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these Terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms or otherwise.

Privacy Policy

Effective: December 1, 2021

Rec Room Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Company", "we", "our", and their derivatives) provides the websites, http://www.recroom.com, http://www.rec.net, and the subdomains of each of the foregoing (collectively, the "Website") and the Rec Room® video game (the "Game" and, with the Website, the "Services").

This Policy sets forth how we collect, use, protect, store, and otherwise process your Personal Information (defined below). This Policy does NOT apply to information we collect offline or you provide to or is collected by any third party (except as otherwise provided below).

For our practices regarding children, please see the Children's section in Section 2 below.

1. What types of Personal Information does the Company collect?

Generally

We may collect different types of information from you depending on how you use our Services, including Personal Information. "Personal Information" means information that relates to an identified or identifiable natural person. The categories of Personal Information we may collect are listed below. Certain types of Personal Information may fall under more than one category.
Identifiers: We may collect your first, middle and last name, email address, username, postal address, Social Security number or employer identification number, telephone number, IP address, or display name.
Characteristics of protected classifications under California or federal law: We may collect your date of birth or age.
Commercial information: We may collect your sale history in the Game.
Voice data: We may receive your voice data through your microphone. Typically we do not store this information, although we reserve the right to process your voice data locally in certain public room instances for moderation purposes. For moderation purposes, some of this voice data may be recorded and sent to a third party service for additional processing. Any such recordings are anonymized and retained for 30 days. Voice data in private instances is never processed, stored or sent to third parties.
Sensory data: We may receive your voice through your microphone and animation data derived from your head movement and facial expressions (for example through your TrueDepth® camera on certain Apple® devices). We do not store this information.
Internet or other similar network activity: We may collect your play history, running/loaded dynamic link library ("DLLs") on your computer or data gathered from a "small memory dump."
Categories of personal information described in Section 1798.80(e) of the California Customer Records: We may collect your first, middle, and last name, telephone number, physical characteristics, signature, Social Security number, postal address, or account number.
Other categories: We may collect information from the content that you create and share publicly in the Game, and information you choose to reveal in the Game through multiplayer chat or other public functions.

We may also collect information that does not generally identify you but may become associated with your account. We may use information that does not identify you for any permissible business purpose under applicable law.

2. Children Under the Age of 13

This section notifies parents of our practices with respect to the collection of personal information from children under the age of 13 ("Children" and each a "Child") and the use and disclosure of such information. This section only applies to Children and supplements the other provisions of this Policy.

Junior Mode

If a user of the Game self-identifies or is identified by us as being under the age of 13, their gameplay experience will automatically be set as "Junior Mode." In order to comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 and its rules (collectively, "COPPA"), users in "Junior Mode" ("Junior Users" and each a "Junior User") may have access to fewer features of the Game than non-Junior Users. This is designed to limit our access and the access of users of the Services to the Personal Information of Children. Junior Users are restricted from communicating with or otherwise making their Personal Information publicly available to other users of the Services. For example, Junior Users are unable to use "whiteboarding" or voice communication functions of the Game, and Junior Users' display names will be randomized/anonymized.

Registration

Junior Users may register an account with us using a registration process similar to the one adults go through; however, in compliance with COPPA, Junior Users may first be subject to a parental notice and/or consent process prior to activation of their account. To initiate the registration and/or consent process for a Junior User, we collect a Parent's email address, and the Parent is then requested to create a password for their Child's account, as well as supply additional account information and settings. We will automatically generate randomized display names for registered Junior Users.

Use/disclosure

The Personal Information we collect from/about Children is used to give Children access to certain features of the Game and communicate with a Parent about the Child's registration, including for the purpose of verifying their Child's information in connection with registration. We do not share or otherwise disclose Children's Personal Information except (1) as may be necessary to protect the safety of a Child, including by disclosing his or her Personal Information, where appropriate, to law enforcement agencies or for an investigation related to public safety; (2) to enable us to take precautions against liability; (3) to protect the safety and security of the Services; or (4) where required to do so by law or legal process.

We and the third-party service providers listed below may collect or maintain Children's Personal Information through the Services.
Exit Games GmbH
Amplitude, Inc.
Google Analytics
Microsoft Azure

At any time, parents may review their Child's Personal Information maintained by us, require us to correct or delete such Personal Information, request that we delete their Child's account, and/or refuse to permit us from further collecting or using the Child's Personal Information by contacting us using the email address provided above. To protect parents' privacy and security and the privacy and security of Children that use the Services, we may require parents to take certain steps or provide additional information, which we will keep strictly confidential, to verify a parent's identity before we provide any information or make corrections.

3. From what sources does the Company collect Personal Information?

When you choose to use your device microphone for voice chat. In some public room instances voice chat may be processed on device, and in some cases recorded and transmitted to a third party service for moderation purposes. Any such recordings are anonymized and stored for 30 days.
When you respond to a survey or questionnaire, we may collect the information provided.

On Apple® devices running the iOS or iPadOS™ operating systems, Rec Room may request permission to access the following:
Microphone - Rec Room requests access to the microphone in order to support real time voice chat. Voice chat is optional and may be turned off at any time. Rec Room will continue to function (without voice chat) if you choose to deny permission.
TrueDepth® camera - on devices that support it, Rec Room requests access to the TrueDepth® camera in order to animate your in-game avatar in certain scenarios. This functionality is optional and may be turned off at any time. Rec Room will continue to function (without this animation feature) if you choose to deny permission. We don't store this information or share it with third parties.

Automatically From You

We may collect your Personal Information automatically as you use our Services. For example, we may collect your Personal Information as you browse our Website. For more information about our use of automatic tracking technologies and certain choices we offer you with respect to them, please see Section 4 below.

Multi-player platform providers;
Cloud computing providers;
Payment platform providers; and
Data analytics providers.

We abide by this Policy when we use Personal Information provided to us by third parties.

As part of our privacy compliance processes, we review these security procedures on an ongoing basis to consider new technology and methods as necessary. However, please understand that our implementation of security measures as described in this Policy does not guarantee the security of your Personal Information.

Creator Payment Program Rules

Last Updated: May 21, 2021

Below are the terms and conditions that govern use of Rec Room Inc.'s Creator Payment Program ("Rules"). These Rules are part of Rec Room Inc.'s Terms of Service, and the term "Rec Room" and "Services" shall have the meaning set out in such Terms. If you do not agree to these Rules, you may not participate in the Creator Payment Program.
We reserve the right to modify, amend, or terminate the Creator Payment Program and/or these Rules, add, remove, or modify eligibility requirements, and change the exchange rate or required minimums for an exchange of earned Rec Tokens to U.S. Dollars, at any time and for any reason, our sole discretion. The existence of the Creator Payment Program in no way creates an obligation for us to continue the program in the future, nor does it guarantee that Rec Tokens can be exchanged now or at any future time. We reserve the right to deny a cash out payment to any user that we believe may not have met these Rules.

BASIC ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA

If you have a non-Junior account that has been active for at least 30 days, are 18 years of age or older, or 13-17 years of age with a parent or guardian's permission, you may be eligible to exchange earned Rec Tokens for U.S. Dollars at the then current exchange rate set by Rec Room Inc., if, and only if, you meet the following basic eligibility criteria:
You have signed up for an account with our third party payment processing vendor, Tipaliti, met all of their registration and other criteria, and provide all necessary information to set up an account with Tipalti.
You have earned at least 1 million Rec Tokens from other Rec Room users in exchange for access to your original User Content.
You have a current and active subscription to Rec Room Plus.
A verified email is associated with your Account.
You are in compliance with the Terms and with the Code of Conduct, and have not have been suspended in the last 90 days.
You have not previously requested to exchange earned Rec Tokens for U.S. Dollars at any time either in the prior calendar month.

In addition, you understand and agree that you must meet any other eligibility requirements that we or Tipalti or our then current third party vendors may establish from time to time in our sole discretion.

MINIMUM AND MAXIMUM EARNED REC TOKEN EXCHANGE AMOUNTS

As of the date of the last update of these Rules, Rec Room Inc. will require exchange requests to occur in 1 million Rec Token increments, with a maximum of 25 million Rec Tokens per transaction, and only one requested exchange per month. The exchange rate as of the date of these Rules is $400 U.S. Dollars per 1 million Rec Tokens. Rec Room Inc. reserves the right to alter or amend the foregoing at any time, in its sole discretion, without posting a subsequent update to these Rules. Upon your submission of an exchange request, the balance of Rec Tokens submitted for exchange will be deducted from your account pending the approval and processing of such exchange. In the event your exchange request is denied, or is otherwise unable to be completed, such submitted balance of Rec Tokens will be restored to your account.
Based on your Account information and status, on the requirements described in these Rules, and by applicable laws, Rec Room Inc. will make a final determination in its sole discretion as to whether you are eligible to exchange a given increment of earned Rec Tokens for U.S. Dollars.

Initiating an exchange request does not guarantee that you will be able to exchange your earned Rec Tokens for U.S. Dollars. Only we have the authority and discretion to determine if you are eligible to participate in the program or if a specific request will be honored. In addition, our third party payment vendor will have requirements that you must meet to their satisfaction.

TAXES, FEES AND TAX REPORTING

Prior to any U.S. Dollar cash out payments for Rec Tokens being completed, you will be required to provide or file any information or documentation required by any service provider appointed by Rec Room Inc. to process cash out payments, which will generally include an IRS form W-9, among other things. Cash out payments will be reported to the IRS and to you using a form 1099.

Transaction fees may be assessed on each payment (which will be deducted from any amounts that would otherwise be owed to you hereunder) by Rec Room Inc. and/or any service provider we engage to assist in administering the Creator Payment Program.

You are responsible for any taxes that may be owed due to an exchange of earned Rec Tokens for U.S. Dollars. We consider any such exchanges to be payments for services you have provided. You are responsible for ensuring that all payments received, if any, are reported to the proper taxing authorities. Rec Room Inc. shall bear no responsibility for withholding or paying the tax obligations of any user, nor shall Rec Room Inc. be held liable for any failure by a user to timely pay any tax obligations arising from participation in the Creator Payment Program.
